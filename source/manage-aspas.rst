Manage ASPA Objects
===================

.. Important:: ASPA objects and verification are still being discussed
               in the IETF. We don't expect major changes going forward,
               but please be aware that this a new RPKI object type and
               support for it in RPKI validators and routers may still
               be lacking.

               For the moment ASPA objects can *only* be managed through
               the CLI. This allows early adopters to use this new type,
               and allows the industry to build up experience.

ASPA Configurations
-------------------

As with ROA support, Krill lets operators *define* the ASPA *configurations*
for which they want to have ASPA objects. The actual ASPA *objects* are then
created by Krill under any parent where the 'customer AS' is in the set of
received resources. I.e. if theoretically your CA would receive this same ASN
under two different parents, then Krill would create an ASPA object with the
same content under each.

Furthermore, just like with ROAs,Â Krill issues these objects with a default
validity time of 52 weeks, and will automatically re-issue these objects 4 weeks
before they would expire - as long as a configuration still exists and the
customer ASN is held by your CA.

ASPA Configuration Notation
---------------------------

ASPA objects allow operators to specify a list of provider ASNs, in the sense
of BGP rather than in terms of business relations, where their own 'customer'
ASN can send updates. Providers can optionally be restricted to IPv4 or IPv6
only.

Krill uses the following notation style to make it easy to define such
configurations when using the CLI:

.. code-block:: text

   AS65000 => AS65001, AS65002(v4), AS65003(v6)
   AS65001 => <none>

.. Important:: You can only have ONE ASPA configuration for each customer ASN.
              This is because Krill MUST (RFC) create a single ASPA object, for
              all provider ASNs. If you wish to have an explicit empty list of
              provider ASN, use '<none>'.

Add an ASPA
-----------

You can add ASPA definition using the following command:

.. code-block:: text

  $ krillc aspas add --aspa "AS65000 => AS65001, AS65002(v4), AS65003(v6)"

This uses the following API call:

.. code-block:: text
  POST:
    https://localhost:3000/api/v1/cas/ca/aspas
  Headers:
    content-type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer secret
  Body:
  {
    "add_or_replace": [
      {
        "customer": "AS65000",
        "providers": [
          "AS65001",
          "AS65002(v4)",
          "AS65003(v6)"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "remove": []
  }


List ASPAs
----------

CLI:

.. code-block:: text

  $ krillc aspas list
  AS65000 => AS65001, AS65002(v4), AS65003(v6)


API:

.. code-block:: text

  GET:
    https://localhost:3000/api/v1/cas/ca/aspas
  Headers:
    Authorization: Bearer secret

JSON response:

.. code-block:: text

  $ krillc aspas list --format json
  [
    {
      "customer": "AS65000",
      "providers": [
        "AS65001",
        "AS65002(v4)",
        "AS65003(v6)"
      ]
    }
  ]


Update an ASPA
---------------

You can add or remove providers to/from the ASPA configuration for one of
your customer ASNs:

Using the CLI:

.. code-block:: text

  $ krillc aspas update --customer AS65000 --add "AS65005" --remove "AS65001"

Or using the API:

.. code-block:: text

  krillc aspas update --customer AS65000 --add "AS65005" --remove "AS65001" --api
  POST:
    https://localhost:3000/api/v1/cas/ca/aspas/as/AS65000
  Headers:
    content-type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer secret
  Body:
  {
    "added": [
      "AS65005"
    ],
    "removed": [
      "AS65001"
    ]
  }

Remove an ASPA
---------------

You can remove the ASPA configuration for a given customer ASN.

Using the CLI:

.. code-block:: text

  $ krillc aspas remove --customer AS65000

Or using the API:

.. code-block:: text

  krillc aspas remove --customer AS65000 --api
  POST:
    https://localhost:3000/api/v1/cas/ca/aspas
  Headers:
    content-type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer secret
  Body:
  {
    "add_or_replace": [],
    "remove": [
      "AS65000"
    ]
  }
